# Propensity_Score_Matching
Standard approach for matching users in Quasi-Experimental Designs is Propensity Score Matching (PSM). We used PSM to rule out any radical parameters that possibly could yield uncertain results. In PSM method, users in treated group and control group will be matched based on their propensity scores. Propensity score can be obtained from the logistic regression and is defined by the probability of a user being assigned to a particular treatment given a set of observed confounding variables. PSM are used to reduce the selection bias by equating groups based on these confounding variables. We match the users from the treated group with a user in control group with equivalent propensity score.
